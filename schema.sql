-- ============================================================
-- PLU ARMY — Schema (single file, always current)
-- Run in Supabase: SQL Editor -> New Query -> paste all -> Run
--
-- This is the ONLY schema file for this project. Whenever
-- something needs to change, this file gets updated in place —
-- there are no separate patch files to track or re-apply.
--
-- This REPLACES the old schema entirely. It drops the existing
-- tables and all their data (messages, photos, accounts) AND every
-- Supabase Auth login, and rebuilds everything from a clean slate.
-- Running this file always means everyone re-registers from scratch
-- afterward — including you.
--
-- BEFORE running this, also do the one-time dashboard steps in
-- SUPABASE_AUTH_SETUP.md — this SQL alone is not enough, login
-- won't work until that's done too.
-- ============================================================

-- ============================
-- 0. CLEAN SLATE
-- ============================
-- Wipes ALL existing app data AND logins — messages, photos,
-- accounts, and the Supabase Auth logins behind them. Every time
-- this file is run, you start completely fresh: nobody can be left
-- with a login that has no matching profile (the "Account found,
-- but no profile on file" error), because logins and profiles are
-- always wiped together, in the same run.
--
-- This means: after running this file, EVERYONE — including you —
-- has to register again from scratch through index.html. There is
-- no way to preserve old accounts across a run of this file.

-- generated here — it's always the same id Supabase Auth
-- assigned when the person signed up, which is how the database
-- knows "this row belongs to whoever is currently logged in."

-- 3. HELPERS: "is the currently logged-in person an admin / active?"
-- ============================
-- Used throughout the policies below instead of repeating the same
-- subquery everywhere. security definer + a fixed search_path so
-- they reliably read the users table regardless of who calls them.

-- 4. GUARD TRIGGERS
-- ============================
-- Row-level security controls WHICH ROWS you can touch, but not
-- which COLUMNS within an allowed row. These two triggers close
-- that gap: they silently snap sensitive fields back to their old
-- value unless the person making the change is actually allowed
-- to change that field, no matter what the request body says.

-- Nobody can flip their own is_admin/is_active — only an admin
-- editing someone ELSE's row can do that. (admin.html also warns
-- before even trying, so this never has to silently no-op there —
-- but the trigger is the real, non-bypassable enforcement.)

-- their own message can't sneak a pin through.

-- USERS
-- A deactivated person can still read their OWN row (needed so the
-- app can see is_active = false and sign them out) but nobody else's.
-- Active members and admins can read everyone's basic profile info
-- (names/avatars need to show in the chat).
create policy "active users can read profiles" on users
  for select using (
    auth.uid() = id or public.is_active_user() or public.is_admin()
  );

create policy "you can create only your own profile" on users
  for insert with check (auth.uid() = id);

create policy "you or an admin can update a profile" on users
  for update
  using (auth.uid() = id or public.is_admin())
  with check (auth.uid() = id or public.is_admin());

-- POSTS
-- Must be active (or admin) to read anything at all. Active users
-- see all non-deleted posts, plus their own deleted ones; admins
-- see everything regardless. Deactivated non-admins see nothing.
create policy "visible posts are readable by everyone" on posts
  for select using (
    ((is_deleted = false or auth.uid() = user_id) and public.is_active_user())
    or public.is_admin()
  );

  for update
  using ((auth.uid() = user_id and public.is_active_user()) or public.is_admin())
  with check ((auth.uid() = user_id and public.is_active_user()) or public.is_admin());

-- REPLIES (legacy table, kept for compatibility — the app
-- currently threads replies via posts.reply_to instead)
create policy "active users can read replies" on replies
  for select using (public.is_active_user() or public.is_admin());

-- ============================
-- 6. STORAGE (post-media bucket)
-- ============================
-- Creates the bucket itself, not just its policies — on a brand
-- new project there is no manual "create a bucket in the
-- dashboard" step to remember; this file is enough on its own.
-- public: true means uploaded files are reachable by their URL
-- without a signed link, matching "anyone can view media" below.

values ('post-media', 'post-media', true)

on storage.objects for select
using (bucket_id = 'post-media');

-- ============================
-- 7. REALTIME
-- ============================
-- 'users' is included so the app's live "you've been deactivated"
-- listener (setupSelfStatusMonitor in index.html) actually receives
-- the update the instant an admin deactivates someone, instead of
-- listening to a stream that was never switched on.

alter publication supabase_realtime add table likes;
alter publication supabase_realtime add table users;

-- ============================
-- 8. AUTO-CLEANUP (90-day message expiry)
-- ============================
-- Runs once a day on its own, no dashboard steps needed beyond having
-- pg_cron available (enabled automatically below). Permanently deletes
-- any message older than 90 days, along with:
--   - its likes, replies, and any reports filed against it (handled
--     automatically — those tables already cascade-delete when their
--     post is removed, see section 1)
--   - its uploaded photo or voice note file in Storage, deleted here
--     explicitly since Storage files don't auto-delete on their own.
--     (Profile avatars live under a separate avatars/ path and are
--     never touched by this — only post media is time-limited.)

create extension if not exists pg_cron;

create or replace function public.delete_old_posts()
returns void
language plpgsql
security definer
set search_path = public
as $$
begin
  -- Remove the media file first, while the post row (and therefore its
  -- content URL) still exists to read the file's path from.

        and created_at < now() - interval '90 days'
    );

  delete from posts
  where created_at < now() - interval '90 days';

-- Safe to re-run: drops any existing schedule with this name first, so
-- running schema.sql again later never creates a second duplicate job.

-- 9. SEED YOUR OWN ADMIN ACCOUNT
-- ============================
-- Do this AFTER completing SUPABASE_AUTH_SETUP.md and after you've
-- registered your own account through the app once (as a normal
-- member, name: Byereta Samuel, phone: 0779477048).
--
-- IMPORTANT: run ONLY the single line below by itself in SQL
-- Editor at that point — do NOT re-run this whole file again to
-- reach it, since section 0 would wipe the registration you just
-- did (and everyone else's) right back out.
